# Security Audit Report
**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Scope:** Supabase project security review for production readiness

## Executive Summary

This audit reviews security practices across the codebase, focusing on:
- Authentication and authorization
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Sensitive data exposure (console logs, environment variables)
- API route security
- Database access patterns

## Critical Issues Found

### ✅ FIXED: Service Role Key Exposure
**File:** `src/features/admin/services/baseAdminService.ts:107`
**Issue:** Logs first 20 characters of service role key to console
**Risk:** Service role key prefix could be used for reconnaissance
**Fix:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Removed service key logging. Only logs operation type in development mode. Error logs sanitized to prevent information disclosure.

### ✅ FIXED: Client-Side Tracking Data Exposure
**File:** `src/hooks/usePageView.ts:37,56,66`
**Issue:** Console logs tracking payloads and responses in client-side code
**Risk:** User behavior data exposed in browser console
**Fix:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - All console logs (log, warn, error) are now conditional and only execute in development mode. No tracking data exposed in production browser console.

### ✅ FIXED: Server-Side IP and Account ID Logging
**File:** `src/app/api/analytics/view/route.ts:79-86,119-123`
**Issue:** Logs IP addresses and account IDs to server console
**Risk:** PII exposure in server logs
**Fix:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - IP addresses and account IDs are never logged. Only boolean presence flags are logged in development mode. All error logging sanitized to prevent PII exposure.

### ✅ FIXED: Error Details Exposure
**File:** `src/app/api/feed/route.ts:133-137`
**Issue:** Logs detailed error hints and details that could expose internal structure
**Risk:** Information disclosure about database schema/errors
**Fix:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - All error details (hints, details, stack traces) are only logged in development mode. Client responses sanitized to prevent information disclosure. Full error objects only logged in development.

## Security Review by Category

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

#### ✅ Strengths
- Middleware properly checks authentication for protected routes
- Admin routes use `requireAdminApiAccess()` helper
- Server-side auth helpers (`getServerAuth`, `requireServerAdmin`) are properly implemented
- API routes check for user authentication before operations

#### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement
- Some API routes rely solely on RLS without explicit auth checks
- Consider adding rate limiting for authentication endpoints

#### API Route Security Status

**Protected Routes (Require Auth):**
- ✅ `/api/feed` POST - Checks auth before creating posts
- ✅ `/api/billing/*` - All routes check authentication
- ✅ `/api/admin/*` - All routes require admin role
- ✅ `/api/analytics/view` POST - Optional auth (tracks anonymous views)

**Public Routes (RLS Protected):**
- ✅ `/api/feed` GET - RLS handles visibility filtering
- ✅ `/api/categories/*` - Public read access
- ✅ `/api/businesses/*` - RLS policies control access

### 2. Row Level Security (RLS)

#### ✅ Tables with RLS Enabled
- `accounts` - Users can view/update own account, admins can view all
- `posts` - Visibility-based policies (public, draft, members_only, only_me)
- `map_pins` - Public read, authenticated users manage own pins
- `categories` - Public read access
- `cities`, `counties` - Public read access
- `notifications` - Users see own notifications
- `page_views` - RLS enabled
- `businesses`, `business_locations` - RLS enabled
- `profiles`, `onboarding_answers` - User-specific access

#### ⚠️ RLS Policy Patterns
1. **Ownership Pattern**: `user_id = auth.uid()` or `account_id` check
2. **Visibility Pattern**: `visibility = 'public'` for public content
3. **Admin Override**: `is_admin()` function for admin access
4. **Public Read**: `TO authenticated, anon USING (true)` for public data

#### Recommendations
- Verify all tables have RLS enabled (check migration files)
- Consider adding RLS policies for any tables missing them
- Test RLS policies with both authenticated and anonymous users

### 3. Sensitive Data Exposure

#### Console Logging Issues

**Client-Side (Browser Console):**
- ✅ `usePageView.ts` - **FIXED** - All console logs conditional (dev-only)
- Various components log debug info (should be dev-only)

**Server-Side (Server Logs):**
- ✅ `baseAdminService.ts` - **FIXED** - Service key logging removed, error logs sanitized
- ✅ `analytics/view/route.ts` - **FIXED** - IP addresses and account IDs never logged, only presence flags in dev
- ✅ `feed/route.ts` - **FIXED** - Error details only logged in development, client responses sanitized
- `middleware.ts` - Logs auth errors (filtered for session errors)

#### Environment Variables

**✅ Properly Scoped:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are correctly used for client-side access
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is server-only (not in NEXT_PUBLIC)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` are server-only

**⚠️ Review Needed:**
- Verify no secrets are in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables
- Check `.env.example` doesn't contain real secrets (it has example values, which is fine)

### 4. API Security

#### Input Validation
- ✅ Most routes validate input types and required fields
- ✅ Entity type validation in analytics routes
- ⚠️ Consider adding request size limits
- ⚠️ Consider adding rate limiting

#### Error Handling
- ✅ Most routes return appropriate HTTP status codes
- ⚠️ Some routes log full error details (should sanitize in production)
- ✅ Webhook routes properly verify signatures (Stripe)

#### CORS & Headers
- ⚠️ Review CORS configuration for API routes
- ⚠️ Consider adding security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

### 5. Database Access Patterns

#### ✅ Best Practices
- Service role client only used in admin operations
- Service role client properly isolated (not exposed to client)
- RLS policies enforce access control at database level
- Admin operations verify admin role before using service client

#### ⚠️ Considerations
- Service role bypasses RLS - ensure admin checks are always performed
- Verify service role key is never exposed to client-side code

## Recommendations

   - Add security headers middleware
   - Implement CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options

3. **Input Validation**
   - Add request size limits
   - Validate all inputs more strictly
   - Consider using Zod or similar for schema validation

4. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Set up security monitoring
   - Alert on suspicious patterns (failed auth, unusual access)

### Long-Term Improvements

   - Add security tests for RLS policies
   - Test authentication/authorization flows
   - Penetration testing before production

2. **Audit Logging**
   - Implement audit logs for sensitive operations
   - Track admin actions, data access, etc.

3. **Secrets Management**
