# Design System Migration Audit & Planning Prompt

## Task
Conduct a comprehensive audit of all pages, components, and UI elements to identify where the Feed Design System (compact government-style minimalism) is NOT currently applied, then create a structured migration plan.

## Process

### Phase 1: Discovery & Inventory
1. **Scan all page files** in `src/app/` and identify every route/page component
2. **Scan all component files** in `src/components/` and categorize by type (layout, feature, UI, etc.)
3. **For each page/component**, analyze:
   - Current spacing patterns (padding, gaps, margins)
   - Typography scale (text sizes, font weights)
   - Border/background styles (shadows, gradients, rounded corners)
   - Icon sizes and spacing
   - Color usage (check for non-gray palette violations)
   - Interactive states (hover, transitions, animations)
   - Overall visual density vs. compact feed aesthetic

### Phase 2: Classification
Categorize findings into:
- **Pages** (route-level components in `src/app/`)
- **Layout Components** (PageLayout, SimplePageLayout, AppWrapper, etc.)
- **Feature Components** (business/, feed/, map/, profile/, etc.)
- **UI Components** (buttons, cards, modals, forms in `src/components/ui/`)
- **Shared Components** (navigation, headers, footers)

### Phase 3: Gap Analysis
For each item, document:
- Current state (specific classes/styles that violate design system)
- Required changes (specific Tailwind classes to apply)
- Dependencies (components used by multiple pages)
- Priority (high: user-facing pages, medium: admin/internal, low: legacy/unused)

### Phase 4: Migration Plan Structure
Create a structured plan organized as:

```
## Migration Plan

### Category: [Category Name]
#### Priority: [High/Medium/Low]

**Pages:**
- `src/app/[path]/page.tsx`
  - Issues: [list violations]
  - Changes: [specific updates needed]
  - Dependencies: [components affected]

**Components:**
- `src/components/[path]/Component.tsx`
  - Issues: [list violations]
  - Changes: [specific updates needed]
  - Used by: [pages/components that import this]

**Estimated Impact:** [number of files, complexity level]
```

### Phase 5: Execution Strategy
For each category, determine:
- **Order of execution** (start with shared components, then pages)
- **Breaking changes** (components used across multiple pages)
- **Testing requirements** (visual regression, responsive behavior)
- **Batch grouping** (components that can be updated together)

## Output Format
Generate a markdown document with:
1. **Executive Summary**: Total pages/components audited, violations found, estimated effort
2. **Detailed Findings**: Organized by category with specific file paths and violations
3. **Migration Plan**: Step-by-step execution plan with priorities
4. **Component Dependency Graph**: Visual representation of which components affect which pages

## Success Criteria
- Every page/component is cataloged
- All design system violations are documented with specific fixes
- Migration plan is actionable and prioritized
- Dependencies are clearly mapped to prevent breaking changes
