- Work: All work types
- Project: All project types

## KEY INSIGHTS:

1. **Everyone needs ACTIVE pipelines, not passive alerts**
2. **Real-time means ACTIONABLE - see who's available NOW, not who might be later**
3. **Location-based matching is the differentiator - proximity = speed = value**
4. **Status tracking is critical - active/in-progress/completed states matter**
5. **Two-way visibility - see who's looking at your pins, see what they're looking for**
